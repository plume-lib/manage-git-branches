# Push one git repository into another, from local clones.  Fails if the
# resulting merge does not compile.  If more than two repositories are given,
# each is pushed into the next in turn.
#
# Usage:
#   git-push-to [--nocompile] FROM_DIR TO_DIR ...
#
# The arguments are directory names for working copies (that is, clones).
# They may be absolute directory names or relative to the current directory.
# The first argument may be "--nocompile" to skip the compilation step.
#
# This script does the following:
#  * pull FROM_DIR and TO_DIR from their remotes,
#  * pull FROM_DIR into TO_DIR,
#  * build TO_DIR using `compile-project` (see its documentation),
#    (Skips the compilation step if environment variable
#    MANAGE_GIT_BRANCHES_SKIP_COMPILE_PROJECT is set.)
#  * push TO_DIR to its remote if the build succeeds.
#
# If more than two directories are supplied, the procedure is performed on each
# pair of adjacent directories in turn.

# Here is an example of use.
#
# Suppose you have 3 branches names "part1", "part2", and "part3".  Each one
# contains the changes in the previous part, plus more.  Each branches is
# checked out in its own directory.  To keep all of these branches in sync,
# whenever you make a change to any branch (including to the main branch), run
# the following command:
#
#   git-push-to \
#     MYDIR/myrepo-branch-main \
#     MYDIR/myrepo-branch-part1 \
#     MYDIR/myrepo-branch-part2 \
#     MYDIR/myrepo-branch-part3
#
# This helps to ensure that you will resolve each merge conflict just once.
#
# The history of the branches will contain many merges (most of which will be
# clean merges that do not require your attention).  If you are using the
# standard squash-and-merge handling of pull requests, the branch history will
# not be reflected in your final repository.

# Here is a more complex example of use.
#
# Suppose you have a branch named "allchanges".  It contains a main set of
# changes, but also two sets of independent changes that should be
# pull-requested separately.  The first part of the changes consists of 3
# subparts that build upon one another, and the second part of the changes
# consists of 2 subparts that build upon one another.
#
# So, you have the following branches.
#  * allchanges
#     * part1   -- a subset of "all-changes"
#        * part1-step1  -- a subset of "part1-step2"
#        * part1-step2  -- a subset of "part1"
#     * part2   -- a subset of "all-changes"
#        * part2-step1  -- a subset of "part2"
#
# You would make 6 pull requests, in order to make each one address just one
# concern.  This makes the pull requests easier to review, and it makes the
# version control history easier to understand.
#
# Assume that you have each of these branches checked out in its own directory.
# To keep all of these branches in sync, whenever you make a change to any
# branch (including to the main branch), you would run the following commands:
#
#   git-push-to \
#     MYDIR/myrepo-branch-main \
#     MYDIR/myrepo-branch-part1-step1 \
#     MYDIR/myrepo-branch-part1-step2 \
#     MYDIR/myrepo-branch-part1 \
#     MYDIR/myrepo-branch-allchanges && \
#   git-push-to \
#     MYDIR/myrepo-branch-main \
#     MYDIR/myrepo-branch-part2-step1 \
#     MYDIR/myrepo-branch-part2 \
#     MYDIR/myrepo-branch-allchanges
