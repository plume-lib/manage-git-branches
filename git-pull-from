# Pull from another directory into the current repository.  Fails if
# the resulting merge does not compile.
# 
# Usage:
#   git-pull-from OTHER-REPO-DIR
# 
# Run this command from within a repository.  OTHER-REPO-DIR may be an absolute
# or relative pathname.

# This script does the following:
#  * pull another directory from its remote,
#  * pull that other directory into this one,
#  * build this one using `compile-project` (see its documentation),
#  * push this one to its remote if the build succeeds.
#
# Calling `git-push-to` is often more readable, because it makes both directory names explicit.
